Waggle Lapdog VS Lapcat

This is a data analysis and visualization project with Microsoft Power BI that focuses on analyzing and visualizating Data using Microsoft Power BI.

I was tasked to create a boardroom-ready Power BI report that tells how the Lapcat data compares to findings from the dog collar Lapdog devices. Lapcat and Lapdog are both devices owned by a fictional pet startup company called Waggle.

Business Requests I had to address in my final report:
*The CEO is curious about the following questions:
*Did the average daily steps increase for cats wearing the device as they did for dogs?
*Were owners of Lapcat devices as satisfied with the product as Lapdog owners?
*The Chief Marketing Officer would like the report to be “on-brand” by including only colors from the ---*Waggle color palette, the Waggle logo, and other approved company logos and icons.
*The product team would like to incorporate other visuals and insights as we see fit but is most interested in demographic comparisons between the dogs and cats using Waggle devices as well as any information about the families who own the pets. They would also like slicers to help them filter and explore on their own.
